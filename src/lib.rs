#![no_std]
#![allow(non_camel_case_types)]

//! A crate to help you go wide.
//!
//! This crate provides SIMD-compatible data types.
//!
//! When possible, explicit SIMD is used with all the math operations here. As a
//! fallback, the fact the fact that all the lengths of a fixed length array are
//! doing the same thing will often make LLVM notice that it should use SIMD
//! instructions to complete the task. In the worst case, the code just becomes
//! totally scalar (though the math is still correct, at least).
//!
//! ## Crate Features
//!
//! * `std`: This causes the feature to link to `std`.
//!   * Currently this just improves the performance of `sqrt` when an explicit
//!     SIMD `sqrt` isn't available.

// Note(Lokathor): Due to standard library magic, the std-only methods for f32
// and f64 will automatically be available simply by declaring this.

// TODO
// Add/Sub/Mul/Div with constant
// Shuffle left/right/by index
